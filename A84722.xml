            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Another MESSAGE FROM HOLMBY.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Moſt honoured Sir.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving long expected the arrival of his Maieſty, whoſe Royall perſon, is now come neer us, I cannot chuſe, but give you a ſalutation of my real affection, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the great favour, which (formerly) you were pleaſed to vouchſafe unto me, and
<pb facs="tcp:114034:3"/>likewiſe (in part) to anſwer your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in things of high concernment, and the whole Kingdoms Object.</p>
            <p>Sir, Since the coming of the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty to Holmby, there hath been a great diſpute between his Maieſty, and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Divines, ſtrong Arguments were held by the King, in defence of the Liturgie and Epiſcopal Government; but many gallant Reaſons were propounded to his Maieſty, (for convincing of his conſcience, and clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his Judgment) by that Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, Mr. Stephen Marſhal; giving many learned and ſtrong Reaſons, in defence of the Government, now eſtabliſhed within the Kingdome of England, by the Authority of both houſes of Parliament: But (as yet) the buſineſſe lyes in diſpence, and his Maieſty hath further declared, that hee cannot give his Royall aſſent, for the confirming and enacting of the Presbyteriall Government; until ſuch time, as he hath conferred with ſome of his own Chaplains, about the ſame, his Conſcience being tender (in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect) for the preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion; And to that end, hath ſent a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:114034:3"/>to both houſes of Parliament, ſignifying his Maieſties gracious will and pleaſure therein; wherein be propounds, ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, concerning his Deſires in Religion. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1, That they would be pleaſed, to grant, that a competent number of his Maieſties Epiſcopall Divines might be ſent downe to Holmby, for the exerciſe of his Maieſties Conſcience, and clearing of his judgment, concerning the preſent differences in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That his Maieſty deſires the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble houſes of Parliament, that they will bee pleaſed to condeſcend, to theſe his Deſires, &amp; grant, that any two of the Epiſcopall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, which he hath formerly mentioned, may be ſent to Holmby.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His Maieſty conceives this to be the beſt and likelyeſt meanes of giving him ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; without which, he ſuppoſeth, the diſtractions of the Church of England, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſetled.</p>
            <p>Thus, according to your expectation, I have briefly given you the ſubſtance of His
<pb facs="tcp:114034:4"/>
               <hi>Maieſties Propoſitions</hi> to both houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>In the next place, <hi>I</hi> ſhall endeavour to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie your deſires, concerning the manner of his <hi>Maieſties</hi> entertainment at Holmby, and his welcomming into that County, by the Gentry of Northamptonſhire, which <hi>I</hi> will briefly intimate, as followeth:</p>
            <p>There were great tryumph at Northam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton upon Tueſday laſt, when the tydings were, brought, that his Maieſty were neere Holmby, the Bells rang, and the great Guns went of, inſomuch, that a gallant eccho made its appeal at Holmby, and the ſound thereof did much reioyce his Maieſties heart; who little thought, that the joy of his ſubiects would have beene ſo great at the arrivall of his Royal perſon.</p>
            <p>Multitudes of people reſorted to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Maieſty, the Road from Harborow to Holmby being adorned with thouſands, and thouſands of ſpectators, crying with a loud voyce (God bleſſe your Maieſty) the King ſmiling upon them, paſſed along cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, ſaying, he hoped this Journey would
<pb facs="tcp:114034:4"/>prove a proſperous voyage, both to him and his Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Many hundreds of the Gentry of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamptonſhire, me this Maieſty two miles on this ſide Harborow, and accompanied his Maieſty to Holmby.</p>
            <p>The bells rang in every town that his Mai. paſſed through, which annexed a double ioy to his Royal heart, cauſing many a ſmile from his Princely countenance.</p>
            <p>At his arrivall at Holmby, there was a gallant guard appointed for his Maieſty to paſſe by, who entred in at the great Court Gate, being accompanied by the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>oners of both Kingdoms, who deport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with much gallantry, performing the truſt repoſed in them faithfully, and their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to their Liege-Soveraign moſt loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. He entred the houſe in great tryumph, and in a moſt ſumptuous maner, taking ſome delight in conferring with the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners about ſome points concerning the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory; they leave no meanes unaſſayed, that may any wayes prove effectual, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading and gayning of his Maieſties Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all aſſent, to ſigne the Propoſitions, and take
<pb facs="tcp:114034:5"/>the Covenant; which we hope, will, ere long prove effectual, deſiring to hear that tryum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant ſound, and comfortable eccho, of the uniting both of Prince and Subject, that ſo peace and truth may flouriſh within his Maieſties Dominions.</p>
            <p>His Maieſty is very pleaſant and chearful, only he deſires to come to, or neare the City of London. But he hath gallant quarrers, and excellent accommodation, there being plenty of proviſions, both for his Maieſty, and his attendants. Sir, no more at preſent, but that <hi>I</hi> ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>
